## Ref: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/blob/metrics-server-helm-chart-3.8.2/charts/metrics-server
##

# Number of metrics-server replicas to run
replicas: 2

apiService:
  # Specifies if the v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io API service should be created.
  #
  # You typically want this enabled! If you disable API service creation you have to
  # manage it outside of this chart for e.g horizontal pod autoscaling to
  # work with this release.
  create: true

hostNetwork:
  # Specifies if metrics-server should be started in hostNetwork mode.
  #
  # You would require this enabled if you use alternate overlay networking for pods and
  # API server unable to communicate with metrics-server. As an example, this is required
  # if you use Weave network on EKS
  enabled: false
